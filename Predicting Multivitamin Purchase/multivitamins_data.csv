Q. Even though Vicks ZzzQuil Natura is not addictive, because we are artificially supplementing Melatonin everyday, will your body get used to an artificial source and stop producing naturally?
No. Melatonin itself is not a drug, it is a natural body-produced substance, your body produces and breaks down Melatonin within the body every day on a daily cycle. The Melatonin you take is broken down by the body naturally, and no studies have reported any dependency or tolerance to the oral supplementation of Melatonin over time."

Cipcal 500 Tablet (Cipla Ltd)

It helps in keeping your bones strong and prevents osteoporosis. Calcium is used for building and maintaining healthy bones. Besides this, calcium plays a very important role in the body as it is necessary for the normal functioning of nerves, cells, and muscles. Our body can get calcium from one of two sources, namely food/diet or bones. When food fails to meet your body’s calcium requirements, it borrows it from your bones. If this happens over a period of time then it leads to bone loss. 

This tablet has a balanced mix of elemental calcium and Vitamin D3.  While calcium is necessary to keep the bones strong, Vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium and phosphorus. Having the right amounts of Vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus is important for building strong bones.

Calcium is also essential for the heart and aids in the clotting of blood. This mineral also helps to treat and manage osteoporosis and to prevent calcium deficiency in pregnant and breastfeeding women. The primary function of Vitamin D3 in the body is to maintain healthy and strong bones. It does so by ensuring calcium absorption in the gut and by maintaining adequate levels of two minerals essential for bone health, calcium, and phosphorus.

Take this capsule as advised by the doctor to get maximum benefit. These tablets are usually safe and don’t cause any side effects when taken as per the doctor's recommendation. 
Key ingredients:
Elemental Calcium: 500 mg
Vitamin D3: 250 IU

Direction for use:
Take Cipcal 500 Tablets as directed by your physician. In general, it is best to take it after meals for better absorption or as recommended by your doctor.
Quick tips for Cipcal 500 Tablet:
If you think that your diet fails to meet the daily dose of calcium, consult your doctor before you decide on taking supplements.
Do not take iron and calcium supplements together, as the absorption of calcium may get hindered.
It is not advised in people suffering from tissue calcification, malabsorption, kidney problems, or blood cancer.
To avoid overdosing on these supplements, inform your doctor if you are taking any other product containing Vitamin D or calcium along with Cipcal 500 tablets.
Do not take these supplements if you are allergic to Vitamin D, calcium, or any other ingredients present in this medicine.
In case you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose at the scheduled time.

Key Benefits of Cipcal 500 Tablet:
Improves the levels of calcium and Vitamin D in your body.

Calcium: Your body cannot produce calcium on its own, so you have to rely on diet and supplements to meet your calcium needs. A lack of calcium could lead to a condition called rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in later life. The symptoms of calcium deficiency include weak nails that break easily, dry and rough hair, dry and scaly skin, and muscle cramps.

Vitamin D: It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods but is available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin D3 deficiency is said to be associated with increased risk of osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones), osteomalacia (softening of the bones), and rickets (a condition in which the mineralization of the bone tissue does not occur properly which can lead to bone softening and occurrence of bone deformities).
FAQs related to Cipcal 500 Tablet:
Q. Is Cipcal 500 Tablet good for health?
When your body has calcium deficiency, it fulfills that need by using the calcium present in your bones, thereby weakening them. It prevents this weakening of bones by supplementing your body with the amount of calcium it needs to keep the bones strong.

Q. Why do you need calcium?
We all know that calcium plays a key role in maintaining strong bones and building strong teeth. This essential mineral also facilitates nerve signal transmission, helps in blood clotting, and aids in the contraction and relaxation of muscles.

Since most of the calcium you obtain from your diet gets stored in bones and teeth, lack of this mineral can impair your bone health and up the risk of osteoporosis. This is the reason, you must fulfill your daily needs of calcium to keep your bones healthy and to maintain your overall well being.

Q. How much calcium and Vitamin D do I need? 
According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of calcium depends on the age. The recommended dietary allowance of calcium for Indian adults is 600 mg whereas, for pregnant and lactating women, it is 1200 mg. ICMR recommends a daily supplement of 400 IU/day of Vitamin D3 for Indians with emphasis on outdoor activities to achieve adequate Vitamin D.

Q. What to do if you have low calcium levels?
Based on your calcium blood test reports, your doctor may advise changes in your diet. For example, if your report shows low calcium levels, you might be asked to increase your intake of foods rich in calcium. Dietary sources that are rich in calcium include dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, and foods that have added calcium like breakfast cereals, soymilk, bread, and bottled water. In cases of severe calcium deficiency, calcium supplements might be prescribed. Remember that calcium supplements should always be taken as per your doctor’s advice.

Q. Which foods are good sources of Vitamin D?
Foods that contain Vitamin D3 include fish such as tuna and salmon, cereals, orange juice, soy milk, dairy products, cheese, egg yolks, and beef liver. The other common dietary sources include natural food sources like cod liver oil, mushrooms as well as Vitamin D3 fortified foods.

Q. Why should one take Vitamin D supplements?
Sunlight is the major source of Vitamin D3. Most people think that Indians have sufficient levels of this vitamin due to adequate sunshine all around the year. But, owing to increased skin pigmentation and suntan, people apply sunscreen and cover their body with full layers of clothing which limits the exposure to UV rays, reducing the synthesis of Vitamin D3 in the body.

Also, the availability of Vitamin D3 through diet is not widespread. Due to the lack of adequate sun exposure, deficient intake of foods rich in Vitamin D3, and lack of food fortification, Indians are susceptible to Vitamin D3 deficiency. This is why one needs to take Vitamin D supplements.

Q. Can excess calcium be harmful?
Dietary calcium is usually safe as it is unlikely to get amounts above the upper limits from food alone. If you take calcium supplements and eat calcium-rich/fortified foods, you may be getting more calcium than you realize; and more isn't necessarily better. Excess calcium can cause bloating, constipation, and an increased risk of kidney stones, prostate cancer, and heart disease.

Q. Should I take a Cipcal 500 Tablet with or without food?
As Vitamin D3 is fat-soluble, it has to be taken with fatty foods. Many people take it with milk. It is easiest to take Vitamin D3 with a meal, but you can also pair it with a fat such as fish oil or a teaspoon of coconut oil. Also, Cipcal 500 Tablet contains calcium carbonate which needs to be taken with food as it requires stomach acid for absorption.

Q. Even though Vicks ZzzQuil Natura is not addictive, because we are artificially supplementing Melatonin everyday, will your body get used to an artificial source and stop producing naturally?
No. Melatonin itself is not a drug, it is a natural body-produced substance, your body produces and breaks down Melatonin within the body every day on a daily cycle. The Melatonin you take is broken down by the body naturally, and no studies have reported any dependency or tolerance to the oral supplementation of Melatonin over time."
